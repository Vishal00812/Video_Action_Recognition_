# Video_Action_Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing human actions in video sequences. The current model is trained to distinguish between two actions: "Stand Up" and "Sit Down".

## Description

The notebook implements a video action recognition model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of video clips labeled with two classes: "Stand Up" and "Sit Down". The objective is to accurately identify these actions in new video sequences.
